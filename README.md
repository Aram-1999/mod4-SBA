# Task Manager

This app is a task listing tool. It provides a form with input fields for the task name, category, date, and status. After the user fills out the form, the task appears in the task table below. The task table is interactive: the user can change the status of tasks using the dropdown menu for each task.

Users can also apply filters. The filters are located below the “Add Task” button in the filter bar. It includes buttons for status: All shows all tasks, Completed shows completed tasks, and so on. The text input field in the filter bar allows the user to type in the desired category.
